    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "I would adopt Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifer, and Naive Bayes Guassian method to be the supervised learning models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For SVM, it suits for doing data classification to find the best hyperplane between two types of data that given different output in a binary situation such as true or flase, etc. And SVM can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths:First, it has a regularisation parameter, which could help the user to avoid overfitting. Second, we can apply Kernel Trick as it can help us to do fast and efficient computation on large dimensional space which means we can handle XOR where Decision cannot. Lastly, we could adopt Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm to fasten its computation speed. Uses a subset of training points in the decision function that called support vectors, so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses:  If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances. And SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation Moreover kernel models can be quite sensitive to over-fitting the model selection criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM application: It is widely applied in biological and science field, such as classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For Decision Tree Classifier, it is a data classification model and it uses layers of filter to determine value of output and classify a binary result. The flow is like, we pick the best attributes, then we asked it a question, it would output a new attribute, we ask it another question and repeat this step to dig deep to the final answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: Each layer would exclude approximately half of the data out, so it could help us to narrow down to our result so effective. We could use Top-Down Learning algorithm (ID3) to help us calculate the entropy of every attribute using the data set. The reason why entropy is extremely useful is because it is a measure of impurity in a bunch of examples that control how a decision tree decides where to split the data. Then, it is simple to understand and to interpret as the trees can be visualised. Next, it can handle both numerical and categorical data which give us larger flexibility to choose the features as some model cannot handle categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weakness: Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree. Moreover, for the decision tree expressiveness, we need to avoid using XOR as it could increase the computation load incredibly. And lastly, Decision Tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well which refers to overfitting. Mechanisms such as setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree Classifier application: It applys in library book use prediction and look for the characterization of Leiomyomatous Tumors, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Naives Bayes Guassian Method, it is also a data classification model. It simply calculate the possibility of an outcome according to the Bayes Rule and the prior we set. And we would use the posteriors to do prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: Compare to other more sophisticated models, it is an extremely fast method. And according to the prior and the Bayes Rule, we can calculate the estimate probability of an outcome occurence instead of approximate it by putting a curve among a dataset. Also the value is interpretable such as 95%. And lastly, it builds a convenient setting for a wide range of models, such as hierarchical models and missing data problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Weakness: It is known to be a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from predict_proba are not to be taken too seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naives Bayes Guassian Application: It applies on checking the email is spam or not, check a a piece of text expressing positive emotions, or negative emotions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And the reasons I choose this three models are because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are not doing regression prediction as our aim is to determine the student is going to pass or not according to the given data. Therefore, classification model is the appropriate way to classify whose going to pass or not. However, if we want to predict the student's examination score, I would adopt regression model instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. These three models are relatively simple. SVM aims to use a linear curve to split the student who gonna pass or fail the exam. Simply split it half. Decision Tree simply decide the student would pass by evalutaing who they are and what they did. And Bayes Learning model is simply calculating every possibility that lead to pass and failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the data I achieved, there are less than 400 entities which means SVM can fully utilise here withput concerning the speed or too much data problem. And there is not only numerical data but categotized data too, therefore, we need to choose model that could handle these two types of data."

Especially, it can predict the best result by using the least amount of training data. Although its run time is the slowest one for each dataset size. However, when we look at the fastest one, the decision tree model, it can't even reach 0.8 with its best score that trained with 300 data. Lastly, the Naive Bayes Guassian Model require 300 data to give the second best result as same as SVM that trained with 200 and 300 data. \n",

You might say what if we have limited time to run the model, I would say it is pointless to run an in accurate model no matter how fast it is as it provides useless result. Moreover, the svm train time for 300 data is 0.0047s. Although it is the slowest one among these models, however, human would not feel anything about this. And assume there are 3,0000 student in this local school, the run time is 0.047s only. We would completely satisfy with this prediction speed. Time would not be the primority parameter we would concern here. Accuracy and consistency with different data size are much more important factors we have to concern in this model.\n",
